# Instructions for Navigating the Interactive Symmetry Map

This is an interactive map that visualizes how different plane pattern symmetries were used to structure ceramic designs over time and space in the prehistoric American Southwest from c. AD 600-AD 1600. The map shows the prehistoric occupation of sites in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and the southern portions of Utah and Colorado superimposed on a USGS topographic map of the area. Users can study symmetry use at a site, region, or temporal period. In addition to studying the changing use of 30 different design symmetries, users can compare these distributions with three different color states (1-color, colored, and 2-color) and 35 different ceramic types. When the program is opened, selection and information boxes appear at the edges. The user must select among different parameter combinations.

The map can be zoomed using the scroll wheel or the buttons in the top left. 

Clicking on a site or group of sites produces a popup box with information about the site(s): site ID #, site name, and the date range of the site as determined by dendrochronological dating and the relative dating of the ceramic types recorded in this data base.

Along the right side of the map, users select in drop down boxes a symmetry and whether they want to study the symmetry of the basic structure of the design or the symmetry of the design complete with embellishing motifs and elements. As well, users can choose to study distributions of one of the three color states, or a specific ceramic type. In the upper right corner, are a series of colored dots, each corresponding to percentage frequency ranges of the usage of the selected feature.

In the lower right corner users can select the time period they wish to study by moving the sliding marker from left to right. To see how a feature changes through time, slowly slide the marker, and the changes in use of that feature is shown by changes in the sites illuminated and in the colors that reflect the different frequencies of use of that feature. When the slider is focused, it can also be moved using the arrow keys. 

Along the bottom right, the number of sites that are currently rendered on screen and the number of designs associated with those sites is displayed. 

In the lower left if the user clicks on the graph icon, a pop up box indicates in a bar graph the number of occurences of each of the symmetries, colors or types selected. To specify the spatial region to plot on the bar graph, move the circle selector to encompass that region. 

To study sites in such a region, the program includes a circle with blue buttons in the center and at the edge. This circle can be moved over the site group. First click outside the circle, then position the cursor over the center blue dot and click to focus it. Once focused, the blue dot can then be dragged around. The same process can be repeated to change the circle's radius by using the blue dot on the edge of the circle.
